# multithreaded-computing
Coursework on parallel programming where a function is calculated in N threads
# About this work
The main goal of the course work is to learn how to manage a multi-threaded system.
The task is not the most useful, since the calculations do not achieve maximum
efficiency under such conditions, but experience is gained in building multi-threaded systems.
