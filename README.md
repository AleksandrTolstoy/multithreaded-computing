# Multithreaded computing
Coursework on parallel programming where a function is calculated in N threads

# About this work
The main goal of the course work is to learn how to manage a multi-threaded system. 
The task is not the most useful, since under such conditions the calculations do not increase linearly and at some point do not give any productivity. 
When performing work, experience has been gained in building multi-threaded systems.

# About code
Uncomment strings in ```src``` directory if you want to see more details about threads

# How to run?
1. Clone or download this repository  
2. Create virtual environment in repository: ```python3 -m venv venv```  
3. Activate virtual environment: ```source venv/bin/activate```  
4. Install requirements: ```python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt```  
5. Run from the terminal as ```./tester.py```  
# Sample of execution
