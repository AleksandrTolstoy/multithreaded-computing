# multithreaded-computing
Coursework on parallel programming where a function is calculated in N threads
# About this work
The main goal of the course work is to learn how to manage a multi-threaded system. 
The task is not the most useful, since under such conditions the calculations do not increase linearly and at some point do not give any productivity. 
When performing work, experience has been gained in building multi-threaded systems.
